# Hello! I'm Nick Pyburn ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer with  over 8 years commercial experience. I'm enthusiastic and love getting my teeth into a good problem. I work well solo, but have great interpersonal skills and thrive in a team setting where I can learn from and benefit others.

### About Me
I'm a developer with experience in:
- **C#**: Where it all started
- **WPF**: Making things look good on Windows (at least trying to)
- **Java & Kotlin**: Writing code and sipping coffee
- **JavaScript & React**: Building web apps and getting lost in state management

Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time learning, coding, and occasionally yelling at bugs. When I'm not working on a new project or refactoring code for the millionth time, I love spending time with my family who are getting better at dragging me away from the screen!

### What Iâ€™m Working On
Currently, youâ€™ll find me juggling a variety of projects. I predominantly write code that drives robots in labs. This could be for instruments which perform a multitude of sciencey tasks, from imaging colonies to picking them. Basically anything that automates work and makes life easier for scientists. I specialise in developing beautiful user interfaces. Working closely with designers to breathe life into their designs. 

### Letâ€™s Connect!
Feel free to check out my repos, drop a comment, or even suggest some cool projects. Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, learning, and sharing ideas.

Happy coding!
