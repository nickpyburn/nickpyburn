# Hello! I'm Nick Pyburn 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where code meets creativity and a dash of humor. 🛠️💡

### About Me
I'm a developer with experience in:
- **C#**: Where it all started
- **WPF**: Making things look good on Windows (at least trying to)
- **Java & Kotlin**: Writing code and sipping coffee
- **JavaScript & React**: Building web apps and getting lost in state management

I’ve spent a lot of time learning, coding, and occasionally yelling at bugs. When I'm not working on a new project or refactoring code for the millionth time, I love spending time with my family who are getting better at dragging me away from the screen!

### What I’m Working On
Currently, you’ll find me juggling a variety of projects. From card games that test your luck 🎴 to trivia apps that challenge your mind 🎤, there’s always something to code and improve.

### Fun Fact
I once wrote a line of code so perfect it ran on the first try. It’s been downhill since then. 😅

### Let’s Connect!
Feel free to check out my repos, drop a comment, or even suggest some cool projects. I’m always open to collaboration, learning, and sharing ideas.

Happy coding!
